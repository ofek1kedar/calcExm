# Git Workshop: Collaborative Calculator

Welcome to the Git workshop! 🎉  
In this exercise, you will work in **pairs** to practice collaboration with Git and GitHub while implementing a simple Java calculator.  

The tasks are simple programming problems in Java — but the main goal is to **experience collaboration**, including branching, pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Work on **feature branches**
- Push and pull changes from a shared repo
- Experience and resolve **merge conflicts**
- Open and review **pull requests**
- Practice basic teamwork in Git

## ⚙️ Setup
1. One of you forks this repository into your GitHub account.
   Use the "_Use this template_" button in the upper right of this page:
   <img width="174" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da2d217-96da-406e-bd7e-6c8c164beb46" />
   
   Then click create a new repository. 
2. Add your partner as a **collaborator** (Settings → Collaborators).
3. Both of you clone the repo locally:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   cd git-workshop-calculator
4. Compile and run the starter program to check it works:
   ```bash
   javac src/Calculator.java
   java -cp src Calculator
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the issues in this repository, copy them to your own clone of the project and assign them to each of you.
> Issues are labled with Student A and Student B. Each of you gets 3 tasks to complete.
> 
> One of you will be Student A and the other will be Student B, assign the issues accordingly.
> 
> **Each task must be in a seperate branch - Branch Per Issue**
